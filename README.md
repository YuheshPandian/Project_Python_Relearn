# Python Relearning Journey  

Welcome to my Python Relearning repository! 🚀  

## 📌 About This Repository  
I created this repository to document my journey of relearning Python from scratch. After a two-year break to focus on academics, I realized how much I missed coding. This project serves as my way to revisit and reinforce every Python concept while sharing my progress with others.  

## 🎯 Purpose  
- Practice and strengthen Python fundamentals.  
- Explore advanced concepts and real-world applications.  
- Share my learning process to help others who are also revisiting Python.  
- Maintain a structured and organized collection of Python programs.  

## 📂 Repository Structure  
- `basics/` – Core Python syntax, data types, loops, and functions.  
- `intermediate/` – OOP, file handling, error handling, and modules.  
- `advanced/` – Algorithms, data structures, and performance optimization.  
- `projects/` – Mini-projects and real-world applications.  

## 👨‍💻 Who Can Benefit?  
- Beginners looking for a structured way to learn Python.  
- Anyone who paused coding and wants to refresh their skills.  
- Developers seeking simple yet effective Python scripts for reference.  

## 🤝 Contributions & Feedback  
This is a personal learning project, but if you find any improvements or have suggestions, feel free to open an issue or discuss in the repository!  

📢 **Let’s learn together and make coding a daily habit!**
