# A variable is a box that can hold a value.
# for example
box = "balls"
name = "Yuhesh"
age = 15

# so from the above example we can learn that a variable can have diff values.
# each variety is called as a datatype

# Different Data types
#string
"yuhesh"
'pandian'

# boolean

True or False
# int form of true is 1 and int form of false is 0

# list
[1,2,3,4,5,6] # mutable, can have duplicate values

# tuple
(1,2,4,65) # immutable

# set
{20,4,2,5} # mutable , can't have duplicates

# dictionary
# It is in key value pair
{"2":"two", "one":1}


# You can check the type of a datatype with help of following code snippet

print(type(name)) # -> gives <class 'str'>
